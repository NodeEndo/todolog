so all you have to do now is to get rid of the Todo Categories: title up top
and all the UI associated with Todo interface
i mean all UI associated with category interface
and just have:
a text field with a label above it called "Todo"
a submit button below
that is the whole app when a user first gets to page
then a user types in a todo name and pressed submit. after pressing submit the todo name appears below the text field and submit button

so there is that header with Todolog title logo
then you see the text field with the place holder text 'write todo here'
and then there is a bottom border on the header DIV

you see that light gray bottom border
ok so that divides the Add Todo UI Header bar from the todo list
The Todos list shows up under the Todo title
you can see that

When you hover over a todo the DONE button appears and the background highlites
when user click Done button, the todo will disappear from the Todo list and appear in the Done list. The Done list appears below the Todo list and is separated by thin gray line. you can see it

so when you hover over a todo that is in the done list, you'd see a delete button show up
but that is not how the delete UI should appear
what if a user by accident presses Done button. how do they get that todo back into the Todo list?
there has to be an Undo button
see?

so if a user hovers over a Done todo, its background turns light gray and an Undo button appears
see it?
When the user clicks Undo button, the todo will disappear from the Done list and reappear in the Todo list at the bottom
