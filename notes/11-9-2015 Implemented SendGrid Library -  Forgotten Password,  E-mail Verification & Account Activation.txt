[ADDITIONS]================================================================================================================
-Implemented Heroku's SMTP addon, SendGrid for sending automated E-mails. 
Right now it is used when the end-user registers a new (non-social) Todolog|Champ account to receive and "Activation" link which ensures that the provided E-mail address by the registrant is indeed their's. SendGrid is also used when the client/end-user forgets their password they are prompted to enter their registered E-mail address which invokes the server to render and register a temporary one in place of their "forgotten" password, they then receive it in their inbox along with directions on how to change it.

-"Forgot your passsword?" feature on the Login route now works.
-"Activation Link" for E-mail verification & to unlock a newly registered 'non'-social media account (username, e-mail & password, registrants).
-The 'Sign up' route layout now looks similar to the Login route, both routes now have the option to choose any of the 3 social media providers (Google, Facebook & or Twitter). The Login route is now purely for logging in however it still checks to see if there's an existing registered Champ account for that specified social media account, the difference is that if it doesn't exist, it now redirects them to the Signup route & clearly prompts the client asking if they wish to continue activating a new Champ account and share their basic profile information (Picture, Display Name, E-mail). Previously the app would imply to the client that they were signing up via the Login route.

ok great. i will test a little later. i had a long day of work.

3lfist [6:58 PM]
a user first sees the Sign Up button on the main splash page

3lfist [6:58 PM]
They click it anad they get this [embed_img]

3lfist [6:59 PM]
They can sign up using social services listed in the left column

3lfist [6:59 PM]
or

3lfist [6:59 PM]
They can sign up using the username,email and password method in the right column

3lfist [7:01 PM]
When a user uses a social service to sign up the service will direct the user to their modal pop up or page for verrification. After the user gives permission the user is brought to the main app page (not the splash page) and is able to then start adding tasks.

3lfist [7:07 PM] 
When a user signs up using their email, after they press the Sign Up button, CHAMP will send an email verification email and also load the 'please verify your email' page. The user will then go to their email account, open the email and click the verify link. That will then open up a new browser tab which displays the 'sign up success!' page. I will design mockups for the email verification email, email verification page and sign up success page later but that is the basic UX flow.

3lfist [7:07 PM]
does it make sense?

3lfist [7:08 PM]
I will make some UX flows later showing the sign up and sign in functionality as well as other CHAMP functionality

3lfist [7:19 PM]
new name for trello board too.

nodeendo [9:15 PM] 
yeah, that makes more sense :simple_smile: I've already have an idea for the verification system... when a new account has been registered it will render an activation serial of sorts which will then be embeded within the link contained in the email body so when they click the verify link it would submit/make a post request  with the serial to be processed and then generate/initialize the users account, kinda like a temporary password.

----- October 30th -----

3lfist [1:32 PM] 
well all that matters is that when the user clicks Verify button/link in the email, that:

1. browser opens a new tab
2. the user's dashboard view loads in that browser tab
3. in that view at the top we see the message "You are now a verified champ! Welcome to the ring!" or something like that

3lfist [1:38 PM] 
i'm testing it out and just signed up with my email address. it says i successfully signed up and to sign in. when i tried signing in it says "Your todolog account "3lfist" is currently not connected to Todolog.". that message is only supposed to show up when signing up with a social account as I understand it. tis an error.

3lfist [1:43 PM] 
so to be clear I get this "maxmythic was successfully registered. You can now log in!" then I enter my log in credentials and it says "Your todolog account "maxmythic" is currently not connected to Todolog." but then when I click the Todolog logo title I see the dashboard where I can add todos and the title "Welcome:maxmythic". Adding this task in Trello

----- October 31st -----

nodeendo [1:57 AM] 
k cool, I understand the verification process you want, thanks for clarifying things :simple_smile:. I can easily fix the login prompt so it only displays when logging in via social accounts.

nodeendo [2:22 AM] 
I'll begin working on the those 2 tasks you described here in the afternoon, what i still consider for myself as tomorrow lol, even though it's 2:22am here... but don't worry I'll refer to the trello board. 
I decided to take a small break because I don't know of any other way to celebrate Halloween by myself. My sister is spending time with my parents again and I have no one to talk to, it's going to be the same for Christmas, she's visiting my uncle and his g/f down in Fl who now live with my grandfather. Basically I'm the only one in my family (including relatives) who is actually alone most of the time.

3lfist [8:28 PM] 
I know. It sucks. Halloween sucked this year. I made a jackolantern and put tea lights in it. It's fairly standard design. Last year's  was better. It was really wicked.

3lfist [8:29 PM]8:29
I like being alone because rarely do I have that opprontunity.

3lfist [8:29 PM]
So does Polly miss your parents a lot? How come you don't go? Cause of fear of travel?

3lfist [8:33 PM]
Cool, let me know how you do with those tasks.  Lately I've had so much on my head. I have to have custom clothes made for me because that is where I'm at in life now. I can't find anything in the stores that suits my neeeds. Also I have to get a bed frame made by a carpenter near by. I was working on a 3d printing project, trying to design a latch n lock for a foldable standing laptop table that I'd put on my desk so I can stand and work but that took forever nad then found out it was super expensive. So I just bought metal L braces and screwed them in. Permannent table now. Whatever, now I don't have to worry about it. Can't fold it but I realize I wasn't going to be doing much of that anyways. how much time do we waste doing unneccesary bullshit. Or is it just me?

3lfist [8:33 PM]
Then there are all these things to buy for the baby. Like a feeding chair n table.

3lfist [8:34 PM]
On top of that stuff there is my part time design job with this start up.

----- November 1st -----

nodeendo [7:24 AM] 
Yeah Polly visits my parents often like once or twice each month, well yeah I wouldn't be comfortable traveling down there with polly, plus I have to take care of her 2 bunnies while she's away.

nodeendo [7:26 AM]
That's cool that you actually carved your own pumpkin, I never really developed any skill to do that, very cool... you probably already know that tatoo artists practice on the skins of produce like fruits and potatoes etc.

nodeendo [9:50 PM] 
k, I just reviewed the tasks you wanted me to do since the 29th, I'm going to begin setting up the e-mail verification

----- November 5th -----

nodeendo [3:02 AM] 
hey man

nodeendo [3:02 AM]
I'm working on the verification with sendgrid

nodeendo [3:04 AM]
Right now I  have it so that when the user signs up the username is used to generate a hash that is used as the verif_code=

nodeendo [3:04 AM]
parameter embeded within the href="?verif_code=" url

nodeendo [3:05 AM]
it's like a temporary password

3lfist [3:05 AM] 
what does an exaple  hash look like?

nodeendo [3:05 AM] 
https://***.herokuapp.com/verify?username=nodeendo&verif_code=217a9d9fffbdbef76096409760560bfd4cef83ac197dcbdd2843a130025c40ed000109d99b0d8cfccf472a78d80c5a14b2d950842c247cb7e61520b196d232b3

3lfist [3:05 AM] 
#FNn3n8f3f#$(FJF34fhk?

nodeendo [3:05 AM] 
yeah

3lfist [3:05 AM] 
coolio :smile:

nodeendo [3:06 AM] 
but it's not the same one used for the password... that's private

3lfist [3:06 AM] 
i thought so. hey is their a way I can get access to the database too?

nodeendo [3:07 AM] 
the problem I'm having right now is parsing the app.get('/verify',function(req,res){req.query.verif_code}); will figure it out eventually

nodeendo [3:07 AM]3:07
yeah sure... ill hook you up as a contributer

3lfist [11:15 AM] 
ok I joined the Heroku project. I want access to the database and all data but I can't seem to get in. I mean I clicked MongoLab and got to that page but I don't see any users or todos.

3lfist [11:15 AM]
maybe we can skype soon and help me figure it out.

nodeendo [4:05 PM] 
weird, not sure what the problem is, I'll check that out soon, I got the verification process working lastnight but I gotta clean up the UX flow.

nodeendo [4:06 PM]
however the functionality is there

nodeendo [4:07 PM]
then I'm going to also add the password reset functionality, and fix the login & signup layout the way you want it.

nodeendo [11:32 PM] 
k just letting you know, I fixed the UX flow when it comes to e-mail verification, I also got the "Forgot your password?" feature working again, it generates a random code for the password and e-mails it.
I have yet still to change the Signup layout, and that social media prompt from the green one to one that looks like the new mockup you have for it, I made a few bugfixes along the way one of them is so that the user isn't prompted anymore when logging in via a non-social media provider| "todolog" for the first time, the account will automatically be activated.

nodeendo [11:32 PM]
tomorrow I'll work on the new prompt and signup layout.

----- November 6th -----

3lfist [12:25 PM] 
ok that sounds great.

TrelloBOT [12:26 PM] 
New card "Change all occurrences of Todolog to CHAMP with in the app (HTML/JS/CSS) and within Heroku and Github repo name if possible" added to list "Todo"

3lfist [12:27 PM] 
And don't worry about getting all the CSS styling of the Signup and Signin layouts perfect, I still have to fine tune the design with in Illustrator. Just get it looking close enough without pulling your hair out :simple_smile:

nodeendo [4:09 PM] 
k, I'm still a bit confused however,  do you want to keep the Login view layout the same with the ability to login with one of the 3 social media providers, and also have the activation prompt display when logging in? 
Or should the activation prompt only display on the Signup view, and have the login view configured so social accounts won't be able to proceed until first prompted via Signup?

nodeendo [4:12 PM]
I need to know exactly how you want it set up, passport works like a box with only one way in and one way out, everything inside (the credentials) is self contained and private, so I won't be able to store the users passport credentials within the Mongo's 'users' table/collection.

nodeendo [4:16 PM]
the 'users' table/collection exclusively houses todolog/champ registrants not passport/social.

nodeendo [4:17 PM]
but all providers generate an 'account' collection/table once signed in for the first time.

3lfist [6:07 PM] 
Ok. Say a user tries to login via a social account in the Login view here and let's say they choose Facebook and let's say they never signed up via their Facebook account. 
So it's a person trying to login with their Facebook account even though they never signed up to CHAMP via their Facebook account. Their Facebook account is not associated/connected with CHAMP. So if they try to do this then they will be shown this [embed_img]

3lfist [6:08 PM]
Then the user can click "Sign up to CHAMP via Facebook" and then they should see [embed_img]

3lfist [6:12 PM]
Does that make sense?

nodeendo [6:26 PM] 
oh okay cool yeah, makes more sense now... so when they click  e.g "Sign up to CHAMP via Facebook" do you want it to switch from the Login view to the Signup view then display the activation prompt [embed_img]? or should that activation prompt be as two separate instances on both Login and Signup views?

3lfist [9:05 AM] 
I think it's smart to when the the user clicks "Sign up to Champ via Facebook" while in the Login view to

1. Switch to Signup view
2. Manifest the activation prompt

So I guess you'll have to create a special function for this which executes the route switch first and then executes the activation prompt. So a syncronous execution. So yeah, basically what we're doing is just switching views and clicking the Signup view's  Facebook button  to automagically bring up that activation prompt.


nodeendo [8:47 PM] 
K, that sounds good I just wanted to make sure I understood exactly what you wanted before investing time, really all I'll have to do is probably do something like $scope.$apply($location.path('/signup')); and then use jquery to invoke the <div> to display|show(). like $('#activation').show(); because once they're logged in via Login view they are usually prompted with that "Sign up to Champ via <provider>" anyhow, it's just an extra prompt letting the user know that they're signing up with that provider for the first time.
