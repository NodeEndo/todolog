---------------------------------------
ADDITIONS: UX (User Experience) Features 
---------------------------------------
[Changed Login Layout]:
The end-user is now greeted with the choice
to either login using an existing social media
account (Facebook, Google, or Twitter) on
the left, or via a registerd Todolog
username/E-mail & password on the right.
---------------------------------------
["Keep me signed in" Checkbox]:
If the end-user/client chooses to login using
a registered Todolog account, they are now given
the option to choose how they want there login
session to expire.

When checked-off or enabled it sets the
'remember' property inside the 'authWithPassword()'
method equal to 'default' which uses the default
24 hour lease configured in the Firebase settings. It
will keep the login session active for 24 hours even if the end-user 
decides closes the browser window before explicitly clicking the 
'logout' button. 

If the checkbox is left unchecked it sets the 'remember' 
property equal to 'sessionOnly' which only keeps the login session
active until either the end-user closes out of the browser
window/tab, or clicks the 'logout' button.
---------------------------------------
[Social Media Initialization Prompt]:
Checks to see if a Todolog account already exists for
a end-users'/clients' social media account login, if not... it displays
a message box containing a message:("Your Facebook account "Node Endo" 
is currently not connected to Todolog.") along with a choice to either "Cancel"
or "Sign up to Todolog via Facebook", Facebook is the provider in this example.

I'm looking at the Forge data and it seems like the data there was added at different times during the dev process. I mean that is obvious.  I see data (of the same structure) being repeated in two places. Look at the 'accounts>3lfist' object and the 'loopback>NodeEndo' object. They have the same data represented. So it makes me think one of them should be killed off.

3lfist [4:42 AM]
I think this is a topic we should definitely talk about though. How about later today after 4pm EST? For me it would be 9 -10pm

3lfist [5:06 AM] 
Backing up a bit. In a basic app with Email & Password signup, the data structure has its top level full of UIDs. And we did not want this because the top level would be disorganized with potentially millions of UIDs. So inorder to organize that it seems like you created 'todolog.firebaseio.com/loopback/uid2usr' to house them. I totally understand that.  What do you think about changing 'todolog.firebaseio.com/loopback/' to 'todolog.firebaseio.com/accounts/' and in ''todolog.firebaseio.com/accounts/' putting 2 objects in there called 'uid2usr' and 'usernames'.  In the 'usernames' object will be objects whose keys are the actual username so I feel there is no need to even repeat it as the key/value store e.g. username : "3lfist". Instead the username object would just contain the UID and email key/value stores

3lfist [5:06 AM]
We can talk about it later but that is my thinking right now. Hope to talk later!

3lfist [2:56 PM] 
Hey. I guess you are on now.

3lfist [2:57 PM]2:57
And will be joining in Slack soon hopefully

3lfist [2:58 PM]
hi

3lfist [2:58 PM]
I thought so :simple_smile:

3lfist [2:58 PM]
How long will you be on for?

nodeendo [3:00 PM] 
hey

nodeendo [3:01 PM]
just got on

nodeendo [3:01 PM]
I just finished reading your thoughts on the data structure, not sure exactly what you're asking for yet I have to see if what you want is possible,

3lfist [3:02 PM] 
Ok I guess it's hard to explain.

nodeendo [3:03 PM] 
the reason why I have a the loopback section is because I was concerned about speed/traffic/usage for people logging in, wanted to keep it separate from accounts...

nodeendo [3:04 PM]
but there are also reasons why uid2usr is separate from the Loopback->NodeEndo->E-mail... because, with Loopback->NodeEndo->E-mail is when the username is provided by the end-user at login but the e-mail needs to be known to actually do an E-mail & Password authentication.

nodeendo [3:05 PM]
it basically asks here's the Username now I need the e-mail then log in with E-mail & password

nodeendo [3:06 PM]3:06
the  uid2usr section is when the user logs in by providing the actual e-mail and password but the username is unknown..... thats why it does a uid2usr because at that point the only known identifier is the UID

3lfist [3:07 PM] 
When I look at the forge right now, I feel like I am looking at chaos. Like all that data was added at different times of the dev process. You know?

nodeendo [3:08 PM] 
the Accounts->(Username+uid)->data is to identify the data unique to that one users account, the Username is added to the UID as a way to make it more legible to one looking at the database entries

nodeendo [3:08 PM]
oh okay, well I havent deleted your data,

nodeendo [3:08 PM]
I left it up so you can compare...

nodeendo [3:08 PM]
you're still using the old config

3lfist [3:09 PM] 
Can we kill all the data in it and start from scratch?

nodeendo [3:09 PM] 
yeah

3lfist [3:09 PM] 
Once you push the new version

nodeendo [3:09 PM] 
yup

nodeendo [3:09 PM]
:simple_smile:

nodeendo [3:09 PM]
i was just about to say that...

3lfist [3:09 PM] 
Good. When will you be pushing?

3lfist [3:09 PM]
haha

nodeendo [3:09 PM] 
tonight a new version should be pushed

nodeendo [3:10 PM]
I have one trello task I'm going to work on today and that's making the login layout and also the password reset look better

nodeendo [3:10 PM]
the way you have in your moqups

3lfist [3:10 PM] 
Sweet. Ok so when that happens you can delete the pre-existing data and we can start populating it from scratch with new user signups and todos

nodeendo [3:10 PM] 
yup!

nodeendo [3:10 PM]
of course...

3lfist [3:11 PM] 
then I will be able to better understand the exact nature of the data structure.

3lfist [3:35 PM]
I've started working more on what the user will be presented after they sign up and sign in. I've also been working on the anatomy of a Todo.  Sketches mainly but will convert them to Google doc.

nodeendo [3:37 PM] 
nice

3lfist [3:38 PM] 
so what else has been going on?

nodeendo [3:39 PM] 
btw, the password reset route I named /reset because I figure there may be an option later on down the line to reset the e-mail address

3lfist [3:40 PM] 
I think /password-reset will make more sense to the end user. is there a reason you didnt want to use that?

nodeendo [3:40 PM] 
figure we could put both password reset and email reset in two separate div's only one interface would display when needed

nodeendo [3:41 PM]
that way we wouldn't have to create a separate file, I used jQuery .html() method to replace the contents of the password reset interface when displaying feedback and giving the option to signup

nodeendo [3:41 PM]
it's as if it has saparate views but reusing the same one

nodeendo [3:44 PM]
I also plan on eventually using better methods if available to handle the client data, I want to keep it as efficient clean as possible so that it's easier to manage future changes

3lfist [3:47 PM] 
the /password-reset/ route is only used when a user needs to reset their password.

3lfist [3:48 PM]
if a user wants to change their email they would just do that in their account settings provided they signed up via Email & Password method

3lfist [3:49 PM]
you know what I mean. This is what most experienced tech users will expect

3lfist [3:50 PM]
unfortunately UX design is a field that is not as creative as fine arts and there do exist a set of best practices that we have to adhere to if we want to create something people will want to use

3lfist [3:51 PM]
i understand your motivation to keep things simple though. it just wont work here

nodeendo [3:53 PM] 
oh alright sounds cool, the only thing is I named the route /reset/ instead of /password-reset/

nodeendo [3:54 PM]
okay

nodeendo [3:57 PM]
i see what you're saying, it's another perspective

3lfist [4:02 PM] 
well its the conformist perspective

nodeendo [4:03 PM] 
you don't have to worry that's how I have it set up actually exactly the way you wanted it on trello and the moqup's

nodeendo [4:03 PM]
just the route is called /reset instead of password-reset :stuck_out_tongue:

3lfist [4:04 PM] 
the term  'reset' in the web app world means a function that the server automatically takes care of

nodeendo [4:04 PM] 
okay i'll change it!! argg....

nodeendo [4:04 PM]
lol

3lfist [4:06 PM] 
when a user changes their email, they are doing it themselves. sure you can see it as them resetting their email, but people never use that term

nodeendo [4:06 PM] 
yeah

3lfist [4:07 PM] 
:smile:

3lfist [4:08 PM]
you see when you start to create your own ideas about how this app should be designed you are playing with UX fire

3lfist [4:08 PM]
and then you begin to waste time and mess up the app

3lfist [4:08 PM]
i am the UX master here. got it?

nodeendo [4:08 PM] 
well's it's an easy fix.

3lfist [4:09 PM] 
I AM THE MASTER~!!!!! OF UX !!!!!

3lfist [4:09 PM] 
I AMAMAMAMAMAMAMAM!!!

3lfist [4:09 PM]
JUST KIDDING!!! NO I A M NOT!!!!! !

3lfist [4:09 PM]
ok

3lfist [4:09 PM]
i'm done

nodeendo [4:09 PM] 
you->"I AM THE CREATOR!"

nodeendo [4:09 PM]
lol k

3lfist [4:09 PM] 
you are the creator

3lfist [4:09 PM]
you are the builder

nodeendo [4:09 PM] 
yeah

3lfist [4:09 PM] 
this is like 50/50

nodeendo [4:10 PM] 
yup you're the designer

3lfist [4:10 PM] 
can you believe I said that 'i'm conformist' ???

3lfist [4:10 PM]
are you going to tell polly?

3lfist [4:10 PM]
hahaah

nodeendo [4:10 PM] 
no

3lfist [4:12 PM] 
i dont care if you do

3lfist [4:12 PM]
i realize that UX is bullshit

3lfist [4:12 PM]
its a shitty field

3lfist [4:12 PM]
but for me it's easy

3lfist [4:12 PM]
i just see emerging patterns in the web/mobile app field and copy them

3lfist [4:12 PM]
and just apply them in diff ways

3lfist [4:14 PM]
i dont want to do this forever you know

nodeendo [4:15 PM] 
i think it's cool actually

nodeendo [4:15 PM]
like you have to put yourself in the clients shoes and see from their perspective

nodeendo [4:16 PM]
may be sort of boring though

3lfist [4:16 PM] 
its kind of fun but i like nature better

3lfist [4:18 PM] 
ok man, i'm out for now.

nodeendo [4:18 PM] 
k, I'll push the update by tonight send you the links on here

3lfist [4:18 PM] 
i can't wait for the new push

3lfist [4:18 PM]
:simple_smile: psyched for it.
